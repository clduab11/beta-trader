I need a plan to implement the following request:

{{{ input }}}

Context:
{{{ files }}}

**Requirements:**
1. Analyze the request against the current codebase structure.
2. Check for any existing patterns or libraries in `{{{ codebase }}}` that should be reused.
3. List the files that need to be created or modified.
4. Provide a numbered list of implementation steps.
