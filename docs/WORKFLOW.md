# Documentation-First Workflow

## Quick Start
1. Read `AGENTS.md` for project context
2. Check `docs/INDEX.md` to discover specs
3. Check `docs/tickets/ROADMAP.md` for current phase and next ticket

## Creating Documentation
- Use templates from `docs/templates/`
- Follow spec lifecycle: Draft → Under Review → Approved
- Record validation in spec's Validation History section

## Phase Gates
- Complete all tickets in current phase before starting next phase
- Only one implementation ticket In Progress at a time
- Peer review and spec writing can overlap

## Authority Rules
- Spec status: authoritative in spec file
- Ticket status: authoritative in roadmap
- Master index: links-only (no status)

## References
- Primary: `AGENTS.md`
- Index: `docs/INDEX.md`
- Roadmap: `docs/tickets/ROADMAP.md`
- Templates: `docs/templates/`
